## Why Does Squishy not have a Discord?

Squishy likes to do things out in the open, this means that Discords model of walled-off communities is not conducive to how we want to do things. In addition to this, there is a trend to moving documentation away from things like Wiki's and websites into Discord servers, which causes that information to no longer be publicly accessible, this is a huge problem when it comes to things like Open Source projects such as Squishy.

All in all, to make things easier on both the maintainers and community members, we are staying away from Discord for the forseeable future. We have an <a href="irc://irc.libera.chat:6667/#squishy">IRC chanel</a> for developer talk and general chatting, and for everything else we have the [GitHub Discussions], [Issue tracker], and this website.
